# Migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Base

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the LNDY social lending platform from Ethereum Mainnet to Base network.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Chain Configuration
- **File**: `src/lib/client.ts`
  - Changed import from `mainnet, sepolia` to `base`
  - Updated `getLauncherContract()` to use `base` chain
  - Updated `getLoanContract()` to use `base` chain

- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
  - Changed import from `mainnet` to `base`
  - Updated `ConnectButton` component to use `base` chain
  - Updated description text from "powered by Ethereum" to "powered by Base"

### 2. Documentation Updates
- **File**: `README.md`
  - Updated network specification from "Ethereum Mainnet" to "Base"
  - Added Base network setup instructions
  - Updated deployment instructions for Base network
  - Added prerequisites for Base network configuration

- **File**: `index.html`
  - Updated meta description from "powered by Ethereum" to "powered by Base"

### 3. Console Logging Updates
- **File**: `src/components/LoanCard.tsx`
  - Updated comments to reflect Base network
  
- **File**: `src/components/CreateLoan.tsx`
  - Updated ETH references to USD in console logs
  
- **File**: `src/hooks/useLoans.ts`
  - Updated ETH references to generic "base units" in console logs

### 4. Configuration Template
- **File**: `env.template`
  - Created environment variable template for Base network configuration
  - Includes instructions for Base deployment

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts (`LndyLauncher.sol` and `LndyLoan.sol`) are network-agnostic and don't require changes. They need to be redeployed to Base network.

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Redeploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   thirdweb deploy
   ```
   Select Base network during deployment.

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` with your actual Thirdweb client ID and Base contract addresses.

3. **Verify Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure your wallet is configured for Base network
   - Get some ETH on Base for transaction fees
   - Test contract interactions on Base

## Key Benefits of Migration to Base

1. **Lower Transaction Fees**: Base offers significantly lower gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
2. **Faster Transactions**: Quicker confirmation times for better user experience  
3. **Ethereum Compatibility**: Base is an Ethereum L2, so all existing smart contracts work without modification
4. **Growing Ecosystem**: Access to the expanding Base DeFi ecosystem

## Network Details

- **Network Name**: Base
- **Chain ID**: 8453
- **RPC URL**: https://mainnet.base.org
- **Block Explorer**: https://basescan.org

The migration is complete and the application is now configured to work exclusively with Base network.
